# Data-Science-Portfolio
In this portfolio you will find Classification, Regression, NLP and Clustering projects. All datasets were obtained from Kaggle website.

In each project was done an end-to-end project, including the following sequence of steps:
- Introduction of the project, giving all the necessary information for the understanding of the project, and a description of the variables used.
- Import of libraries used on the projects.
- Import of the data and getting some basic information of the dataset.
- Data cleaning of the dataset, checking missing values and outliers.
- EDA to plot some charts of the variables, getting useful insights of the problem with the information obtained from the dataset.
- Feature Engineering to adjust some information shown on the dataset to make it possible to run a machine learning algorithm and also doing the feature selection.
- Presets of the model to help the running of the machine learning algorithm, choose of the metrics and fuctions for better visualization of the results given from the models.
- Machine Learning Models, with a list of all algorithm that it will be tested on project and it will be chosen the one with the highest score of the metrics chosen.
- Conclusion of project, summarization of all useful information obtained on project and what action need to be taken to improve the results and revenue of the company.

# Projects
## Classification
- [Bank Client Churn](https://github.com/Guilherme-Yuji/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Bank%20Client%20Churn.ipynb): In this project was analyzed all the information given from the dataset and also it predicts if a client will churn ou not.
- [Bank Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/Guilherme-Yuji/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Bank%20Marketing%20Campaign.ipynb): In this project was analyzed the data that most influences a client to make a deposit to the bank. A marketing strategy was done and also a prediction if of a cliente deposit was made.

## Regression
